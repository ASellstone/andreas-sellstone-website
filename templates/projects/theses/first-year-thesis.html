      <p>In my Master’s program I had the option to write two theses: one at the end of the first year and another at the end of the second year. The thesis “From Keystrokes to Cognitive Processes: Analyzing Morphological Knowledge Using Keystroke Logging” was written at the end of my first year. Here I investigated the application of keystroke logging programs (software that records each pressed keystroke on a computer along with a time stamp) in classrooms when students are taking tests.</p>

      <p>I wanted to investigate if keystroke logging would be useful for teachers and possibly clinicians to identify language related difficulties that would not be seen on ordinary tests taken without keystroke logging. Furthermore, I also investigated students’ morphological knowledge via the test, and connected certain cognitive processes revealed by the keystroke logging data to how morphology is processed cognitively.</p>
